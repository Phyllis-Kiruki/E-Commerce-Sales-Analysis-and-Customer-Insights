# E-Commerce Sales Analysis and Customer Insights

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce dataset, focusing on sales trends, customer segmentation, and churn prediction using machine learning models.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 

    - Identifies top-selling products.

    - Analyzes revenue by country.

    - Visualizes sales trends over time.

    - **Customer Segmentation:** 

    - Performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers.

- **Churn Prediction:** 

    - Defines churn based on recency.

    - Trains and evaluates Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict customer churn.

    - Compares model performance using accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.

    - Analyzes feature importance for churn prediction.

- **Visualization:** 

    - Plots revenue, customer value distributions, and model evaluation metrics.
- **Export:** 
    - Saves cleaned data and RFM segments to CSV files.
- **Recommendations:** 
    - Provides actionable business insights based on analysis.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository or download the notebook.**
2. **Update the data path** in the notebook to point to your local CSV file.
3. **Run the notebook** cell by cell to perform the analysis and generate insights.

## Files

- `data.csv`: Raw e-commerce transaction data (not included, provide your own).
- `cleaned_ecommerce_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- `rfm_segments.csv`: RFM analysis results with churn labels.
- `E-Commerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with all analysis steps.

## Key Insights

- Recency is the most important predictor of customer churn.
- Top countries and products can be targeted for marketing and inventory optimization.
- Machine learning models can proactively identify customers at risk of churning.
